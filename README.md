# A-W_Project
### Idea:
1. Horse Racing simulator
  - Define individual horses by several attributes such as top speed, consistency, weight, endurance, etc.
  - The performance of individual horses will be determined by randomly sampled distributions based on the attributes
  - The race will occur and the final position of each horse will be shown
  - Hopefully would have a cool interface
      - Maybe include an interface that tracks bets on horses
  - Could somehow incorporate data from previous horse races to make the simulations more realistic
