### Data
All current data was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gdaley/hkracing/data)

There are two spreadsheets right now:

**races.csv:**
- Each line is an observation of an individual race's conditions
- Some potentially important features:
    - surface, going (track condition), horse_ratings (range), race_class, placing info, time splits

 **runs.csv:**
 - Each line is an observation of one horse run from one of the races in races.csv
 - Some potentially important features:
    - result, won, lengths_behind, horse_age, horse_contry, horse_type, horse_gear, declared_weight, actual_weight, draw (post position), time & position splits, finish_time, place_odds, trainer, jockey
